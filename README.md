# ironlevel
We were able to accomplish the Iron Level which included creating a 'space ship' that blinks and alternates lights as a button is pressed. We were unable to accomplish more levels as we would have liked because we encountered many difficulties on the first day but we only had a substitue to help. The second day went much better.
